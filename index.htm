        <p>Combat Mission: Cold War! All out war has errupted at the Fulda Gap. Comabat Mission Cold War is Battlefronts 
                5th entry into the series. The game just relased on the Steam Market Place 16 November, 2021. You can also purcharse the game
                directly from Battlefront and the Slitherine Store. The game has be available since June but the Multiplay system has been overhauled.
                This update streamlined the Play by email system. I look forward to seeing you on the Fulda Gap, wargamers.

        <h7>Opinion!</h7>

        <p>Wargaming lacks accessibility and it is destroying both the playebase and developers. Wargaming is a niche hobby but there are some larger wargmames
                with a dedicated playerbase. Wargaming is constanly evolving. Developers are making their gameplay more complex, dynamic, and challenging but 
                they aren't improving tutorials or onboarding. The developers boast about lenghty dry manuals. They brag about complex mechanics. This causes new and even 
                seasoned wargamers to avoid the games. We as wargamers dedicate more time to learning a game than acutally playing it. We buy 500 page manuals and highlight
                critical information. By the time you have the knowledge to play the game a new iteration or wargame has probably released. This is a viscious cycle! It is time
                we as a community solve this problem.
