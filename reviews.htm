        <h7>Consistency or Stagnation</h7>
        <p>Combat Mission: Cold War! All out war has errupted at the Fulda Gap. Comabat Mission Cold War is Battlefronts 
                5th entry into the series. As a newcomer to the Combat Mission series the gameplay and accessibility leaves
                something to be desired. However, this isn't my first Combat Mission game. The series has been around for close to
                two decades. Veterans will not be dissappointed with the gameplay, mechanics, or graphics. The series hasn't evolved much
                in the last 20 years. You can call that consistency or stagnation. It is a niche product that markets itself to a 
                diehard playerbase. 
        <br>

        <h7>The Cold War was era marked by intense conflict and 
                the constant fear of a nuclear holocaust.</h7>
        </p> 
        <p>The Cold War was era marked by intense conflict and the constant fear of a nuclear holocaust. Combat Mission Cold War expands upon this era. 
                The game allows players to use weapon systems and tactics from that time-frame. There are dozens of quick battles across various
                landscapes. The game can be played in two fashions. One is turn-based and the other is realtime. Fans of the series will tell you to play
                turn-based. Each turn is 60 seconds long. This allows you to plan out and execute your strategy. A 30 minute game can take hours if you lose track of time!
                The game features both a Map editor and multiplayer. This creates endless replayability!

                <h7>If it's not brok, Don't fix it!</h7>

        <p>If it's not broke, don't fix it! This is the motto that strategy and wargamers live and die by. While core gameplay mechanics
                vary from game to game. Strategy game controls haven't changed in almost 20 years. They have been refined and adjusted but the concept
                is always the same. Create a box and put some generic orders buttons in it. Combat Mission Cold War sticks to that formula. They do do adjust 
                a few things but it is far from inovative.
